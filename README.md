# classroom-notifier
Classroom Notifier aims to send automated notification emails when any post in a Google Classroom is edited or deleted. This is because Google only sends email notifications for “added” posts.
*DISCLAIMER: The Google account language MUST be set to Korean, otherwise it will not work.
